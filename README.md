# React Native FlatList Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a common bug in React Native's `FlatList` component when dealing with large datasets and complex item rendering.  The issue is characterized by inconsistent rendering: items may be missing, positioned incorrectly, or display stale data even after updates.

The primary cause is often inefficient key management within `FlatList`'s internal recycling mechanism.  Using the index as a key (`keyExtractor`) is a frequent source of problems, especially when the dataset changes frequently.  This results in `FlatList` reusing rendered items inappropriately.

This repository provides both the buggy code and a solution that illustrates proper key management and potential optimizations for smoother rendering of large lists.

## Solution

The solution focuses on using a unique, stable key for each item. This key should ideally be a unique identifier of the item itself, such as an ID from your data source. It's also crucial to optimize the rendering of individual items to minimize performance overhead.

See `bugSolution.js` for a demonstration of the improved implementation.
