This React Native bug arises when using the `FlatList` component with a large dataset and complex item rendering.  The issue manifests as inconsistent rendering, where some items are missing, incorrectly positioned, or rendered with outdated data even after updates. This often occurs due to inefficient key management or improper optimization of item rendering.  The root cause is that `FlatList`'s internal recycling mechanism may struggle to keep up with rapid changes, leading to visual inconsistencies and data discrepancies.

```javascript
// buggy code
<FlatList
  data={largeDataset}
  renderItem={({item}) => (
    <ComplexItemComponent item={item} />
  )}
  keyExtractor={(item, index) => index} // problematic key
/>
```
